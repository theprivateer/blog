For somebody who is technically savvy, I have a fairly skeptical view of AI and its current ascendency in the tech industry.

I do not knowingly or directly use generative AI tools (for writing, coding or research), nor do I use AI ‘assistants’ for automation.

**Everything here is written by me, personally, not an AI.**

Furthermore, I also choose to block AI scrapers and crawlers.

If you want to know why I have this page, read [The /ai 'manifesto'](https://www.bydamo.la/p/ai-manifesto).
