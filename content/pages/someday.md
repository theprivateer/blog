This is a [someday](https://someday.page/) page. It outlines things I someday would like to achieve, accomplish, explore, experience, create, learn, and understand. It is ever-evolving.

## Screencasting

I would love to start recording screencasts around PHP development. I’m fairly introverted, so my main reason for this is to push myself out of my comfort zone.

## Cycling

- Ride an ‘imperial century’ (160km / 100 miles). I’ve technically done this before when I was younger, but want to cross it off again.
- Complete an [Everest](https://everesting.com).

## Running

- ✅ ~~Run 10KM (comfortably and consistently)~~
- ✅ ~~Run a half-marathon~~
- Run a full marathon
