I have spent the past 20+ years honing my craft in agencies, start-ups and scale-ups. My career has spanned industries as diverse as real estate, construction and tourism, with technical roles across back-end, full-stack and technical leadership. I have led software transformations, overseen teams of on- and off-shore developers, and been solely responsible for products generating multi-million dollar revenue. I combine technical pragmatism and commercial acumen with a little creative flair. I favour simple, well-considered solutions over hasty implementations and unnecessary complexity.

## Direct Services

Here are some of the services I provide directly:

### Building applications from the ground up
I build testable applications with a strong focus on engineering principles such as scalability and redundancy. I've built monolithic apps with front ends integrated directly into the codebase, service-oriented APIs that power a Vue- and React-based PWAs, and everything in between.

### Long term maintenance of existing applications
I can take over maintenance of existing projects including security updates, new features, bug fixes, and hosting. As your project grows in popularity I can help you scale up your infrastructure to handle the influx in traffic.

### Refactoring legacy PHP code to Laravel
I have successfully migrated a few profitable, but unmaintainable PHP apps (PHP 4, < PHP 5.3) to modern standards using Laravel (and sometimes Symfony). These applications were all very different but had one thing in common: zero room for downtime. The applications needed to be rewritten one piece at a time, ensuring 100% compatibility with the original code and zero burden on the end user.

### Temporary employee on-boarding
I can temporarily join your existing team to shore up resources during busy periods. In the past I have joined teams to maintain their legacy apps while their internal team worked on a rewrite. I've also worked with internal teams to simply help ship new features.

### Code audits
I can take a look at your existing Laravel/Vue codebase and give you some suggestions on areas that could use improvement. This could be my opinion on how to add a new feature to your app or simply an audit of the health of your application.

### Saving failing projects
If you have a Laravel project that has gone bad, I can help you save this project from failure. Typically this means creating a plan using an audit of the current state of your project, then executing this plan by joining (or replacing) your existing team.
