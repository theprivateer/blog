I have spent the past 20+ years honing my craft in agencies, start-ups and scale-ups. My career has spanned industries as diverse as real estate, construction and tourism, with technical roles across back-end, full-stack and technical leadership. I have led software transformations, overseen teams of on- and off-shore developers, and been solely responsible for products generating multi-million dollar revenue. I combine technical pragmatism and commercial acumen with a little creative flair. I favour simple, well-considered solutions over hasty implementations and unnecessary complexity.
