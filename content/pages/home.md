# Hi, I'm Phil

I've been building things on the web for more than twenty years. I started out training as an architect, moved into design, and eventually found my way into software development in the early 2000s. Since then, I've worked across product, engineering, and leadership roles, helping teams and businesses build software that actually gets used.

These days my work sits at the intersection of engineering, systems thinking, and people. I care about how software is built, but just as much about how decisions are made, how teams work together, and how technology fits into real life.
