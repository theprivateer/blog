I'm originally from the UK, but moved to Australia in 2013. I live in Brisbane with my wife, our two kids, and two cavoodles.

## Work

I originally trained as an architect, which shaped how I think about structure, systems, and design. In the early 2000s I moved into digital design and then into software development.

I’ve spent over 20 years working in software, primarily in hands-on engineering and technical leadership roles. This has included mentoring engineers, guiding system architecture, working closely with product and other stakeholders, and supporting teams through change and growth.

I tend to take a pragmatic, long-term approach to work, with a focus on clarity, sustainability, and building things that hold up over time. [You can view my resume here](/resume).

## Interests

Outside of work, besides the [occasional software side-project](/category/projects) I spend my time refining my wood-fired pizza technique, cycling on the road and on trails, and running. I started running in the past year and a half and am currently training for my first marathon, the [Gold Coast Marathon](https://goldcoastmarathon.com.au).
