I'm originally from the UK, but moved to Australia in 2013. I live in Brisbane with my wife, our two kids, and two cavoodles.

## Work

I originally trained as an architect, which shaped how I think about structure, systems, and design. In the early 2000s I moved into digital design and then into software development.

I’ve spent over 20 years working in software, primarily in hands-on engineering and technical leadership roles. My background is technical, with experience as a developer and technical lead, and over time my responsibilities expanded into engineering leadership. This has included mentoring engineers, guiding system architecture, working closely with product and other stakeholders, and supporting teams through change and growth.

I tend to take a pragmatic, long-term approach to work, with a focus on clarity, sustainability, and building things that hold up over time. [You can view my resume here](/resume).

## Interests

Outside of work, besides the [occasional software side-project](/category/projects) I spend my time refining my wood-fired pizza technique, cycling on the road and on trails, and running. I started running in the past year and a half and am currently training for my first marathon, the [Gold Coast Marathon](https://goldcoastmarathon.com.au).
