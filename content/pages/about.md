I'm a part-time cyclist and full-time software developer.

I live in Brisbane, Australia with my wife and two kids and I spend way too much time looking at bikes on the internet.

I'm currently a Technical Lead at [Rex](https://www.rexsoftware.com/), responsible for building and maintaining both the [Rex Websites](https://www.rexsoftware.com/products/real-estate-websites) and [Rex Reach](https://www.rexsoftware.com/products/real-estate-marketing) products.
