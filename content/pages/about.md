I'm a (mostly) backend web developer with a focus on PHP and [Laravel](https://laravel.com).

Originally from the UK, I live in Brisbane, Australia with my wife and two kids.

Previously I have held Technical Lead / Senior Engineer roles at [Rex](https://www.rexsoftware.com/), [Databee](https://databee.com.au) and [iSeekplant](https://iseekplant.com.au). I’m currently enjoying a break from work to spend more time with the family and consider what I want to focus on next.
