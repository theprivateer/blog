## Reading

I’ve fallen off the wagon in recent months when it comes to my reading habit. Here’s what I have in progress, though:

- [Shift](https://www.kobo.com/au/en/ebook/shift-16)
- [The Daily Stoic](https://www.kobo.com/au/en/ebook/the-daily-stoic-366-meditations-on-wisdom-perseverance-and-the-art-of-living-featuring-new-translations-of-seneca-epictetus-and-marcus-aurelius)
