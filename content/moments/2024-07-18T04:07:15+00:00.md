Just finished reading Pines by Blake Crouch - can't help but feel the [TV adaptation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2618986/) (which I haven't seen) sort of ruins the twist with its advertising material.

Thoroughly enjoyed the book - binged it in a couple of days. Reminded me a bit of a Dean Koontz novel (which I read _a lot_ of when I was younger).
