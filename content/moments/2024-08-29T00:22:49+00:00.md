I’ve been using my 5th generation iPad Mini with my 1st generation Apple Pencil for years - how have I never figured out that you can ‘wake up’ the Bluetooth connection by bringing the pencil to the slightly magnetised edge of the iPad? So many times I’ve been taking the cap off and plugging it into the Lightning port to ‘pair’ it 🤦
