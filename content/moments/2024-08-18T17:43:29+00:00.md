Spent some time converting my [Bookshelf](/bookshelf) page - all the books I've read in the past few years - from a static list to a more dynamic record-based list similar to the [365 Albums Project](/albums).

I plan on adding some interesting functionality around filtering and linking books by type, author, genre and series, as well as eventually adding some notes to help me summarise what I took away from each book.
