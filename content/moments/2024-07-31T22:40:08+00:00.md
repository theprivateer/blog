Just injected a new lease of life into our old 27-inch iMac (circa 2017) by removing Chrome and following the steps at [chromeisbad.com](https://chromeisbad.com/). Was previously pretty much unusable - now it's fairly snappy (for a machine running an actual hard drive rather SSD or Fusion drive). Chrome is indeed bad.
