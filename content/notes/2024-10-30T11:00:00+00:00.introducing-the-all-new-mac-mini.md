This is probably one of the best Apple ads in a long time. Doesn’t take itself too seriously - the [category of Apple marketing](https://youtu.be/yk6UVnMn9ts?si=ZUHdlWTAFE4T42eo) that I like. Plus, strong LEGO Movie vibes.

I have no need for a desktop Mac right now, but the new form factor (and not to mention the specs) are very compelling.
