A great, well-considered writeup of the state of Apple one week after the latest iPhone / Apple Watch release event. Gruber is one of the few Apple pundits (and tech journalists in general) that I actually like, and this timely piece captures a lot of how I feel about Apple.

A while ago I found myself considering leaving the Apple ecosystem (spoiler: I haven't) - I wrote a lot of drafts about my thinking at the time that I never published, but this article has me considering finishing off that piece with all my reasons for coming full-circle. Maybe I'll resurrect [my blog](/blog) and do just that.
