For the past three months I have been using Obsidian exclusively for note-taking and it has been a game changer for me.

I don’t use ‘Read It Later’ apps as most of the content I consume comes from RSS feeds. However I’ve found ‘Read It Later’ behaviour to be the perfect use-case for **Obsidian Web Clipper**, a powerful first-party extension for Safari - more so than Safari’s own ‘Reading List’ functionality.

It enables you to save pages (or parts of pages) directly to Markdown-formatted notes in your Obsidian vault, alongside lots of useful metadata. Since it is just another note, it is synced across all my devices and available offline. It also saves a snapshot of the web page, so if it is updated I still have the original content. I’m excited to try this for the next couple of months to see how it improves my content consumption.
