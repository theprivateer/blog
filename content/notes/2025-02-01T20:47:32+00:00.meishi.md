[Arun Venkatesan](https://arun.is/blog/meishi-cards/):

> **Meishi** embodies Rams’s principle of “less but better” by enforcing limits. Each card represents a commitment to do fewer things, but do them well. Most satisfying of all is that by solving this particular problem, I’ve found that small solutions can lead to big impact.

Aside from the fact that this requires the carrying of a pen / pencil, I do like the idea of this minimal (literally) productivity system. I’m considering a more analogue method of managing my to-do list, and the [Ugmonk Analog](https://ugmonk.com/en-au/collections/analog) system that inspired this is definitely up for consideration.
