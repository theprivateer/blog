Kagi, a ‘user centric’ (and paid) search engine, maintains what is essentially a webring to find random posts from the various small web bloggers and the entire list is maintained, out in the open, via a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb).

Even if you aren’t a Kagi user, this is an amazing resource of some excellent creators. I’ve seen a few familiar names on there, but also found a lot of new people to follow also. You can submit your own recommendations as well, if you fork the repository and then submit your suggestions.
