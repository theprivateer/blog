I've been a loyal user of **Reeder** (more specifically [Reeder Classic](https://www.reeder.app/classic/) as it has now become) for many years, but today I decided to give NetNewsWire a go. The 'Today' smart feed is _exactly_ what I've been looking for - before today I was considering resurrecting [Subworthy](/posts/introducing-subworthy) to add a more ethemeral / temporal aspect to my feeds (I may still).
