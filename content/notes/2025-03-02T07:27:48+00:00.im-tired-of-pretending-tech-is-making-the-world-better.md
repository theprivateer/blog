Joan Westenberg:

> Faced with the relentless, myopic, growth-at-all-costs optimism that seems to surround our tech overlords and their toys, all I can think is that I'd rather give up 99% of the consumer-tech "improvements" to go back to a world where things felt a little bit harder, and a lot more human.

This perfectly encapsulates a feeling of uneasiness that has been growing in the back of my head. I need more time to contemplate what this all means to me and how I intend to address it, but this from [Scott Boms](https://scottboms.com/documenting/through-lines-247) is a good start: 

> I miss being excited by technology. I wish I could see a way out of the endless hype cycles that continue to elicit little more than cynicism from me. The version of technology that we’re mostly being sold today has almost nothing to do with improving lives, but instead stuffing the pockets of those who already need for nothing. It’s not making us smarter. It’s not helping heal a damaged planet. It’s not making us happier or more generous towards each other. And it’s entrenched in everything — meaning a momentous challenge to re-wire or meticulously disconnect. I’m slowly finding my own ways of breaking free to regain a sense of self and purpose.
