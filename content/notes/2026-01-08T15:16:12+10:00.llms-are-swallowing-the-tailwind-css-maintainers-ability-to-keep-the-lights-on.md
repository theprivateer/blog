> But the reality is that 75% of the people on our engineering team lost their jobs here yesterday because of the brutal impact AI has had on our business.

Could this be the beginning of the end for the CSS framework? Maybe it's time for Laravel Holdings Inc. to buy / bail them out?

**UPDATE:** Looks like [Vercel](https://nitter.net/rauchg/status/2009336725043335338) and [Google AI](https://nitter.net/OfficialLoganK/status/2009339263251566902) already swooped in to save the day, as it were. No word of the Tailwind employees that lost their jobs, though.
