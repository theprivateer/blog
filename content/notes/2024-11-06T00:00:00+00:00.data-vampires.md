I recently came across the [Tech Won’t Save Us](https://techwontsave.us) podcast via a post on [Denny Henke’s blog](https://beardystarstuff.net/).

Looking at the episode list for an interesting entry point I was immediately drawn to this limited four-part series diving into the rise, impact and uses of massive ‘hyperscale’ data centres worldwide.

I guess I was already aware of the resource demands of data centres, but perhaps not overtly aware of the scale of them worldwide, as well as some of the more political reasons for their locations.

This series gave me a lot to think about - especially regarding AI and the longtermist outlook of tech billionaires - but I won’t go over here. Best you go listen for yourself.
