[Will Tavlin](https://www.nplusonemag.com/authors/tavlin-will/) for **n+1**:

> In 2021 Netflix announced that it would start releasing a new original movie every week. A certain style soon began to take shape, a mind-numbing anticinema that anyone who has subscribed to Netflix in recent years knows by sight. I’ll call it the Typical Netflix Movie (TNM).

I’m not a huge Netflix viewer - I mainly use it to watch ‘mainstream’ movies that make it onto the platform, plus the occasional comedy special or documentary.

I was recently recommended **Black Doves**, the Keira Knightley thriller that is undoubtedly Netflix’s answer to the excellent **Slow Horses** on Apple TV+. Whilst it is a series as oppose to a movie, it still has all the hallmarks of the Typical Netflix Movie.

> The characters’ dialogue is stilted, filled with overexplanation, clichés, and lingo no human would ever use, like two bots stuck in a loop.

Despite the implausible and unmemorable plot, the real deal-breaker for me was a particular piece of dialogue. At numerous points throughout the series, English characters wish each other “Happy Christmas”. Here’s the thing, no one from the UK wishes people “*Happy* Christmas” - it’s “*Merry* Christmas” (and a happy New Year) - and it’s jarring every time a character says it.

1-star - would not recommend.
