I absolutely love the simplicity of the new PlanetScale website. At first I thought maybe it was a mistake, but no, it’s legit. It’s a bold choice for an enterprise-level platform, but man it is ticking so many boxes for me (probably helps that I love using minimal apps like [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer)).

Not sure how long this redesign will stick around, but I definitely feel some inspiration for this site coming on...
