This year, I'm deliberately rethinking my relationship with technology, and AI sits right at the centre of that shift. Not because I'm chasing novelty, but because the pace and volume of information in everyday life have crossed a threshold where old approaches are no longer enough.

I'm moving back into employment and looking at more management-focused roles, which brings a different rhythm to the day. At the same time, life outside work is just as demanding. I have two school-aged children with busy schedules, extra-curricular activities, and all the coordination that comes with them. Between work, home, and the background noise of modern life, there's a constant stream of information that needs attention.

For a long time, my response to that pressure was to look for simplicity. I've read the books, tried the systems, and experimented with productivity frameworks designed around focus, calm, and reduced cognitive load. They're thoughtful ideas, but most assume conditions that rarely exist in the real world. Long stretches of uninterrupted time, minimal interruptions, and predictable schedules aren't luxuries that management roles or family life often provide.

That mismatch is part of what's changed my thinking. Rather than trying to force idealised systems onto a complex reality, I'm more interested in tools that can help me operate effectively within it.

Until recently, AI wasn't something I felt comfortable leaning on outside of work. There was too much hype, too much loose thinking, and an uncomfortable narrative around replacing human judgement. It felt more distracting than helpful. But that stance has softened as the technology has matured and the conversation has become more grounded. 

I'm not interested in grand claims about artificial general intelligence. What I am interested in are practical capabilities that already exist. Tools that can summarise information, organise inputs, surface patterns, and reduce the background noise that competes for attention. When used with intent and clear boundaries, large language models can act as support rather than substitution.

The key issue for me is agency. I want to use AI to offload the mechanical parts of managing information, not the thinking that actually matters. Drafting, summarising, exploring options, and connecting dots are all areas where AI can be helpful, especially when time is fragmented. Decision-making, judgement, and responsibility stay firmly human.

That shift in perspective has made me look again at the tools I already use every day, particularly within the Apple ecosystem. Notes, Reminders, Calendar, Shortcuts, and Mail are already central to how I manage work and home life. The opportunity now is in how intelligence gets layered into those tools, rather than bolted on as something separate.

Automation and AI start to overlap here in useful ways. Small, dependable workflows that capture information automatically, structure it consistently, and make it easier to retrieve later reduce the mental bookkeeping that builds up over time. When combined with AI that can help interpret and summarise that information, the overall system becomes far more resilient to interruption and context switching.

This is where the announcement about Apple partnering with Google to use Gemini to power Apple Intelligence becomes particularly interesting. Apple's cautious approach, especially around privacy and on-device processing, suggests a focus on assistive intelligence rather than attention-grabbing features. If AI shows up quietly in the tools I already rely on, supporting everyday tasks across work and home, that's where it has real value.

None of this is about optimisation for its own sake or trying to extract more output from every hour. The goal is protection. Protecting time, energy, and attention in a life that is full by default. If AI can help reduce friction, clarify priorities, and make it easier to stay present, then it earns its place.

As I work through this shift, I plan to share the tools, methods, and workflows I adopt, particularly where AI genuinely helps and where it falls short. I'm interested in what holds up under real-world conditions, not theoretical ideals. If you've found ways to use AI that support your thinking without replacing it, I'd genuinely like to hear about them. Comparing notes feels like a useful way to navigate what's changing, and I'm looking forward to the conversations that follow.
