It has been a busy couple of weeks leading up to the end of semester at the kids’ school, with plenty of after-school commitments (performing arts concerts, end-of-semester exhibitions) contending with our already-busy schedule of extra-curricular activities.

In amongst all of this I was able to find time to rebuild and relaunch my website (although admittedly this hasn’t been _that_ much work) and start training towards running 5K.
