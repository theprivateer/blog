After 3 years and 9 months I have decided to move on from Rex. It has been an exciting roller-coaster ride, seeing the company change and grow over such a relatively short period of time.

Rather than jumping straight into a new role I'm going to take a break. Over the next few months I'll be spending more time with the kids, working through a never-ending list of household to-do's, and giving myself space to figure out what my next professional adventure is going to look like.
