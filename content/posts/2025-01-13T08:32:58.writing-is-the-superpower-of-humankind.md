[James Clear:](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/january-2-2025)

> Writing is the superpower of humankind. It is our truest form of magic.\
\
Writing allows you to conjure up something of value where nothing previously existed. It costs little for you to write down the lessons of your life and yet those few minutes spent writing can be life-altering for the right reader. As I once saw it put: “there is someone out there with a wound in the exact shape of your words.”\
\
Furthermore, writing is the foundation of nearly every technology and innovation because we have to record what we know before we can build upon it. And these innovations are passed down from generation to generation, allowing our children to inherit a richer intellectual fortune than what we were born into. The world is richer because we write and nobody is made poorer in the process.

_This_ sums up perfectly why I am intent on building my writing habit 2025.
