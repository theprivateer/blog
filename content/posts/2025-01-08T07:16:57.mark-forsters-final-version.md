I’m always on the lookout for new productivity / time-management systems - researching different philosophies and techniques has become something of an unofficial hobby of mine (just check out some of the titles in the [non-fiction](/reading#non-fiction) section of my reading list).

> There are three main requirements which have to be kept in balance. These are urgency, importance and psychological readiness. Traditional time management systems have tended to concentrate on the first two of these. The neglect of psychological readiness is probably the reason that most people don’t find time management systems particularly effective or congenial.\

The most distinctive feature of FV is the way that its algorithm is primarily based on psychological readiness —  this then opens the way to keeping urgency and importance in the best achievable balance.

I love both the simplicity of this system and the fact it addresses procrastination head-on.
