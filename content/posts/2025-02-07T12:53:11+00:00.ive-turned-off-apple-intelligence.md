Today I turned off **Apple Intelligence** on all of my devices. 

Apart from the fact this initial release has been widely panned (with hints in their marketing at [appealing to sociopaths](https://notes.ghed.in/posts/2024/selfishness-in-ai/)) I just don't use any of the tools, and the notification summaries add no value to me. I won't be missing anything.

This is not an anti-Apple stance. Like a lot of what Apple does, this has just been a swing and a miss for me - and that’s okay. If and when it genuinely gets better I may turn it back on, but for now, I'm good.
