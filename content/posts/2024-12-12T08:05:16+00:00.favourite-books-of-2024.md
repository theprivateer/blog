A common-thread you can find in the non-fiction books I read is productivity and well-being (both physically and mentally). Productivity is always going to be a hot-topic, especially in a world where every day seems to demand more, more, more. However I tend to gravitate towards books that aren't about productivity for productivity's sake - but more quality over quantity, and making room for 'life'.

## Do Pause - by Robert Poynton

If you've never come across the [Do Book Co.](https://thedobook.co) (and by extension the [Do Lectures](https://thedolectures.com)) I strongly suggest you check them out. I like that whilst they cover a wide variety of subjects by different authors, to the editors' credit they form a cohesive collection 'to encourage and inspire'.

I bought digital copies of a number of Do titles for a trip to the UK earlier this year, but Do Pause stood out in particular (with an honourable mention going to [Do Walk](https://thedobook.co/products/do-walk)). This accessible little book champions the benefits of pausing every now and again - even if just for a short time - as a sustainable approach to coping with always-on nature of modern life.

## Slow Productivity - by Cal Newport

I'm a longtime fan of Cal Newport's work ([Digital Minimalism](https://www.kobo.com/au/en/ebook/digital-minimalism) had a particularly profound impact on me). When I heard he had a new book that covered productivity _and_ escaping the trap of non-stop activity and 'busy-work' it was a no-brainer to pick it up.

In typical Newport style the book takes a deep dive into the concepts briefly covered in books like [It Doesn't Have To Be Crazy At Work](https://www.kobo.com/au/en/ebook/it-doesn-t-have-to-be-crazy-at-work-1), and has given me a solid list of strategies to try when I return to work in 2025.

## Bonus Fiction Title: Project Hail Mary - by Andy Weir

I also read a lot of fiction. I don't have to think too hard and it's a great alternative to mindlessly browsing Netflix of an evening. Fiction titles are also pretty subjective, with different genres and writing styles making it hard to recommend books. However this is one that really stood out this year - with the exception of [The Thursday Murder Club series](https://www.kobo.com/au/en/series/the-thursday-murder-club) that really should be read as a whole - this is one book that I really could not put down and binged over the course of a few days.

I picked it up on a whim while waiting at the airport to come back from the UK earlier this year. I had finished all of the other (non-fiction) books I had loaded on my eReader for the trip and fancied a bit of science fiction. I had never read any of Andy Weir's work (although I enjoyed the big-screen adaptation of The Martian), but this novel came highly recommended (it's even one of Barack Obama's Reading Picks, for whatever that is worth).

I didn't start reading it until we got back to Australia, but I was instantly hooked. The first-person writing style combined with short, punchy chapters and believable (although not necessarily real) science made this hard to put down.

And then there's the twist...

Definitely check this one out if you're into some grounded easy-to-read science fiction.
