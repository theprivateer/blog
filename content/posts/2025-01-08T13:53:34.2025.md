title: "2025"

I’m not a big believer in New Year’s resolutions - in my experience whenever I’ve set myself *goals* for the year ahead life has often found a way to derail them.

Instead of discreet goals (e.g. run a marathon) this year I am aiming for habits. If I can maintain these habits they may eventuate in meeting one of my [/someday](/someday) goals, but then again they may not - and that’s okay. Inspired by [Carl Barenbrug](https://carlbarenbrug.com/@/page/qRcXmbr9K3lDesU2), here is my list of what is ‘in’ and ‘out’ for me in 2025:

## In

- Mindfulness
- Blogging
- Screencasting
- Running
- Learning
- Wood-fired pizza[^1]
- Swimming
- Family time
- Self-care
- Strength training
- Calm

## Out

- Mainstream news
- Comparison
- FOMO
- Clutter
- Rushing
- Over-committing
