When Caleb first [demoed Flux](https://youtu.be/31pBMi0UdYE) at Laracon US I didn’t really pay much attention - mainly due to lack of bandwidth.

It surfaced again at Keith Damiani’s [talk at Laracon AU](https://youtu.be/KLgTi9YmT5A) (which I was lucky enough to attend in person) as a shortcut to rapidly building an app, so I circled back to take a closer look.

Whilst it isn’t something I can see myself using a great deal in my day job (and have little space for side-projects) I have ended up purchasing an unlimited license. Watch the original talk from Laracon US to get an idea of the level of passion that has gone into building this - this is not just another UI kit. The insights into building a truly accessible dropdown menu is worth the purchase price alone!

This isn’t the first time I’ve paid for something from Caleb, and I doubt it will be the last, but I do think it is important to support creators like this.
