title: "Dynamically Registering Custom Twig Functions and Filters"
---

I have used the [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com) templating engine in a number of large projects - particularly CMS-based platforms. Whilst I favour Laravel's built-in Blade engine, Twig is ideal for user-generated templates as it is fast and secure, only allowing execution of pre-defined functions.

It is easy to extend the base set of [functions](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/functions/index.html) and [filters](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/filters/index.html) to match the capabilities of your application. You can do this by registering custom extensions to the Twig environment before rendering your templates:

```php
$twig->addExtension(new YourCustomExtension);
```

The extension can then register any number of custom functions and filters. Typically you would combine the function / filter registration and execution methods in the same class (this example is for a Laravel application, so we can leverage some core functionality):

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Str;
use Twig\TwigFunction;
use Twig\Extension\AbstractExtension;
use Twig\Extension\ExtensionInterface;

class YourCustomExtension extends AbstractExtension implements ExtensionInterface
{
		public function getFunctions(): array
    {
	    return [
		    ...
		    new TwigFunction('get_current_path', [$this, 'getCurrentPath']),
		    ...
	    ];
    }
    
    public function getCurrentPath(): string
    {
	    return request()->path();
    } 

		...
		
		public function getFilters(): array
		{
			return [
				...
				new TwigFilter('truncate', [$this, 'truncate']),
				...
			];
		}
		
		public function truncate(string $string, int $length = 100): string
		{
			return Str::of($string)->limit($length);
		}
		
		...
} 

```

The example above will allow us to use the following custom function and filter in our Twig templates

```twig
{{ get_current_path() }}

{{ some_variable|truncate(50) }}
```

This is an effective approach, but over time as your requirements grow and you add more and more custom functionality to your templates, the custom extensions will also grow.

## Dedicated Function and Filter Classes

I was drawn to the way in which [Statamic](https://statamic.com) automatically registers  custom [Modifiers](https://statamic.dev/extending/modifiers#creating-a-modifier) (the equivalent of Twig filters, but for the Antlers templating language). You simply generate a modifier class - one class per modifier - and drop it into the the `App\Modifiers` namespace and it is automatically available. I wanted to do something similar for Twig.

We'll take the same approach for filters and functions, so let's start with the `get_current_path` function from the example.

```php
namespace App\Twig\Functions;

class GetCurrentPath()
{
	public function handle(): string
	{
		return request()->path();
	}
}

```

Nothing special here - just a basic PHP class with a single `handle` method (it could be anything - Statamic modifiers use an `index` method).

In this instance the custom function classes will live in the `App\Twig\Functions` namespace, alongside any number of other custom functions.

The formatting of the class name is important as we will rely on a common convention for generating the related Twig function signature. In this instance we will convert the class name into snake-case, so `GetCurrentPath` will become `get_current_path`.

The `truncate` filter will follow the same pattern, but live in the `App\Twig\Filters` namespace:

```php
namespace App\Twig\Filters;

use Illuminate\Support\Str;

class Truncate()
{
	public function handle(string $string, int $length = 100): string
	{
		return Str::of($string)->limit($length);
	}
}

```

## Automatic Registration

We want to automatically discover all functions and filters in our dedicated 'custom' namespaces. For this we will use the [haydenpierce/class-finder](https://packagist.org/packages/haydenpierce/class-finder) package - a simple utility that will return an array of all classes in a given namespace.

```
composer require haydenpierce/class-finder
```

To keep things nicely separated we will keep the registration of custom functions inside the helper extension:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Str;
use HaydenPierce\ClassFinder\ClassFinder;

class YourCustomExtension extends AbstractExtension implements ExtensionInterface
{
		public function getFunctions()
    {	    
	    $functions = [];
	    
	    // Prevents the ClassFinder looking inside vendor directories
	    ClassFinder::disablePSR4Vendors();
	    
	    $classes = ClassFinder::getClassesInNamespace('App\Twig\Functions');
    
	    foreach ($classes as $class) {
			    $functions[] = new TwigFunction(
			        Str::of(class_basename($class))->snake(),
			        [new $class, 'handle']
			    );
			}
    
	    return $functions;
    }
} 
```

The `ClassFinder` utility will return an array of class names in a given namespace. We then loop through the classes, registering a `TwigFunction` using the snake-cased version of the class name as the function signature. We target the `handle` method on the class for executing the method.

The approach for registering filters is identical, except for the namespace and the _type_ of Twig class that we are registering, so we can refactor this slightly.

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Str;
use HaydenPierce\ClassFinder\ClassFinder;

class YourCustomExtension extends AbstractExtension implements ExtensionInterface
{
		public function getFunctions()
    {	 
	    return $this->registerHandlers(
		    type: TwigFunction::class, 
		    namespace: 'App\Twig\Functions'
	    );
    }
    
    private function registerHandlers($type, $namespace): array
		{
		    $handlers = [];
		    
		    ClassFinder::disablePSR4Vendors();
		    $classes = ClassFinder::getClassesInNamespace($namespace);
		
		    foreach ($classes as $class) {
				    $handlers[] = new $type(
				        Str::of(class_basename($class))->snake(),
				        [new $class, 'handle']
				    );
				}
		
		    return $handlers;
		}
} 
```

We can then register our filters by adding the following method to the customer extension:

```php
public function getFilters()
{
    return $this->registerHandlers(
	    type: TwigFilter::class, 
	    namespace: 'App\Twig\Filters'
    );
}
```

## Finishing Up

This is a very basic implementation and there is a lot of room for improvement.

We are blindly assuming that there will always be a `handle` method on the custom function / filter classes, so it's a good idea to add some checks before registering the class. Since the  `handle` method could potentially accepting any number of arguments we can't use an interface - however a simple `method_exists` check will probably do the trick.

One thing I like about this approach is that is makes each custom function and filter easily testable, so adding some unit tests would be a great addition.
