title: "Supporting Creators"
---

I follow quite a few independent content creators via RSS, email newsletter and podcast. I am increasingly getting greater value from these than I do from more mainstream sources, so I have decided to do the right thing and start supporting some financially.

Whilst I would love to be able to support all of the content creators I follow that just isn't feasible for me. Instead I am going to be hand-picking a few different creators, with a view to adding one or two more over the next few months.

My first round of subscription dollars goes to the [Tech Wonâ€™t Save Us](https://patreon.com/techwontsaveus) podcast and [Joan Westenberg](https://www.joanwestenberg.com).

Both represent independent critical perspectives of the tech landscape and its impacts on society. They also both provide the majority of their content free of charge so I recommend you check them out.
