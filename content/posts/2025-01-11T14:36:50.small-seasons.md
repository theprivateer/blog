> Prior to the Gregorian calendar, farmers in China and Japan broke each year down into 24 sekki or “small seasons”. These seasons didn't use dates to mark seasons, but instead, they divided up the year by natural phenomena

As someone who has moved from the northern hemisphere to the southern hemisphere and had their seasons shifted against the calendar year[^1] (and those seasons are so much more extreme and unrecognisable to what we experienced in the UK) I love the idea of taking a completely different view on the passage of time throughout the year.
