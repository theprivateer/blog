A fortnight update this week, mainly because I’ve let my journalling habit slide a bit and haven’t been tracking what I’ve been up much lately.

The most notable event has been one of our team members leaving at work. [Dylan Park](https://dylpark.com/) joined us a fresh-faced frontend developer a couple of years ago and in that time has grown into a very capable engineer, and a pleasure to work with. He’s heading off for bigger and better things at [The Lens](https://www.lens.org/) and will be sorely missed.

His last day required a trip to the office and the traditional visit to [Smokey Moo](https://smokeymoo.com.au/) for a team lunch.

I’ve been playing about with [Filament](https://filamentphp.com/) component framework for a potential project at work. I am equally impressed with the power and ease of use, as I am disappointed with how much I have taken my eye off the ball with advances in the [TALL](https://tallstack.dev/) stack.

With that I have decided to double-down and focus on developing my TALL capabilities by leveraging it to accelerate a few personal projects. There will be more about this in a dedicated blog post.

I’ll be [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) this for my own more immediate needs  - starting with this blog. Whilst there is absolutely nothing wrong with [Statamic](https://statamic.com/) (I was even going to make that the focus of my focussed learning) I will be rebuilding this site on a custom CMS backed by TALL technologies.
