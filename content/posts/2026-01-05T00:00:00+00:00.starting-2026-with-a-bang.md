After a decade of gainful employment, with a brief sabbatical to reset, I'm heading back out into the world of freelance and contract work.

I'll be available for gigs requiring back-end development (PHP / Laravel), application architecture and technical leadership. I'm also doubling-down on my website design and development roots - with a particular focus on performance, usability and accessibility.

**For more on how I can help take a look at my [/work](/work) page.**

I'll have a limited number of slots available over the coming months, so if you think I might be able to help you (or somebody you know) let's chat - if you're Brisbane-based I'll even shout you a coffee!

Looking forward to the next chapter.
