Iâ€™ve been going back and forth over what I want my online presence (i.e. this website) to be.

First, it was a blog, with regularly posted content with no real consistent theme. Then I wanted to break out of the constraints of having to post linearly by creating a digital garden, at which point I missed having the ability to surface content temporally (i.e. it was relevant at a specific point in time).

I'm still not 100% there, and suspect I'm going to end up with a hybrid of both, but for now I'm back to a simple blog.

For a short while I experimented with using Obsidian and Obsidian Publish to create a digital garden - I found it to be a pretty effective publishing flow and will certainly circle back to that once I have a better idea of the shape of that content.

Inspired by sites like [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net), and the personal websites of [Freek Van der Herten](https://freek.dev) and [Matt Birchler](https://birchtree.me), I also want to be able to easily share interesting links, especially when they are the jumping-off point for something I want to say.

So for now I'm back to using [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.tighten.com) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to create and host a simple static site - one day I'll take some time to change up the underlying publishing layer to detach it from Git pushes. I've also decided to simply archive all of my previous content - some of it may find its way into the digital garden, but for now this is a clean start.
