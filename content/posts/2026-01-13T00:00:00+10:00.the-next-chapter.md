It's been almost seven months since I stepped away from [Rex Software](https://rexsoftware.com). Over that time, I've taken the chance to reset, learn, and spend more time with my family. It's been invaluable, but now I'm ready to dive back in.

Software building still fascinates me. There's nothing quite like getting hands-on, creating something that helps people, and seeing it come to life. That part of the job has always been incredibly rewarding.

What I've missed most, though, is technical leadership. I love creating environments where developers feel confident to experiment, learn, and have fun while shipping solid, reliable systems. Guiding the architecture of platforms - big and small - mentoring developers, and connecting people has always been a central part of my professional passion.

In 2026, I'm looking to advance my career in technical leadership. I'm seeking engineering manager roles, or technical/team lead positions with a clear path toward engineering management. I'm not rushing into the first opportunity - I want something long-term, not just a stepping-stone.

I'm excited to see what the next chapter holds and to continue building software that makes a difference while helping teams thrive.
