At work I will often need to decode a JSON or Base64-encoded string to more-easily examine the data. Using online tools like [jsonformatter.org](https://jsonformatter.org) and [base64decode.org](https://www.base64decode.org) are certainly convenient, but not exactly great for security.

**Boop** is a fantastic native desktop tool for doing all of that (and much more). I find myself launching it multiple times a day.
