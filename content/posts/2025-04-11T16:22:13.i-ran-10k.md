title: "I ran 10k"
---

Last night I surprised myself by running 10km non-stop for the first time.

I was running laps of the [North Lakes Parkrun](https://www.parkrun.com.au/northlakes/course/) course whilst my daughter was attending a session at the local YMCA, and only intended on matching my previous best of ~6.5km, which is four laps of the lake. However at the end of the fourth lap I just kept going... and going.

I only started running for the first time about a year ago, and was pretty on-and-off towards the end of 2024, so I’m really happy with my progress.

I’m registered to run the 10km event at the [Gold Coast Marathon](https://goldcoastmarathon.com.au) in July, and then the [Jetty2Jetty](https://www.visitmoretonbayregion.com.au/j2j) half-marathon a couple of weeks later.

Whilst it is still 12 weeks out, it is good to know that I _can_ run the 10km distance without too much trouble and can now knuckle down and concentrate on training for the half-marathon distance.
