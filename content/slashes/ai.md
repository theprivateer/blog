For somebody who is technically savvy, I have a fairly skeptical view of AI and its current ascendency in the tech industry.

I do not knowingly or directly use generative AI tools (for writing, coding or research), nor do I use AI ‘assistants’ for automation.

**Everything here is written by me, personally, not an AI.**
