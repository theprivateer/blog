I'm a part-time cyclist and full-time web developer, with a focus on PHP and [Laravel](https://laravel.com).

Originally from the UK, I now live in Brisbane, Australia with my wife and two kids.

I'm currently a Technical Lead at [Rex](https://www.rexsoftware.com/), responsible for [Rex Websites](https://www.rexsoftware.com/products/real-estate-websites) and [Rex Reach](https://www.rexsoftware.com/products/real-estate-marketing).
