I use the default Apple Mail app for my _personal_ email, and the Gmail app (on iOS / iPadOS) or web interface for our shared inbox. I really don’t want to have all my emails from different sources coming into one app (especially since our shared inbox gets a lot of newsletters and promotions for things only my wife is interested in).

The default Apple Mail client is fine for me - as of December 2024 I’m not particularly impressed by the Apple Intelligence features that have rolled out, but I’ll stick with it since it is clearly a cornerstone of Apple’s product direction moving forward (and I have faith that it will get better). I also like the fact that it is a general-purpose email client that will work with any IMAP server - unlike the HEY email app experience (once again, that deserves a dedicated post).
