I’ve tried a lot of different browsers, but my preference for now is **Safari** across all of my devices. It may not be the fastest most feature-rich browser, but I like its deep integration into the Apple ecosystem and the fact that for the most part it is stable. Also, I prefer to give Google as little information as possible.

For a while I made a concentrated effort to use [Orion](https://kagi.com/orion/), but it just didn’t gel with me.

I really like what Orion (and by extension **Kagi**) represents, and really wanted to like it. I accept that it is still in beta and would occasionally crap-out on some of the SPAs I use (especially on iPad), but the lack of system-level integration with Apple Passwords, plus some other UI / UX quirks added too much friction to make up for it’s good intentions.

I’m open to trying it out again in the future - especially if Apple continues to not offer Kagi as a default search engine option for Safari.
