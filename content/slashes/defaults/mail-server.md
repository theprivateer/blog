My emails are currently split between three services. First of all I have a joint email address with my wife that we set up years ago on Gmail, and we mainly use for signing up to stuff for our household / shared services.

For personal email I started subscribing to [HEY](https://hey.com) a few years ago, but have decided to move away from the service before my next renewal date for reasons I will one day write about.

Since as a family we get iCloud+ as part of our Apple One subscription I have setup a custom domain on iCloud mail, and am using that as my mail server. iCloud mail isnâ€™t the most performant, but to be honest it does the job.

All HEY emails get automatically forwarded to my iCloud mailbox. I also have an old legacy Gmail account that was forwarding to HEY, but that now forwards straight to iCloud. My aim is to completely phase out both accounts by early 2025.
