The best way to reach me is by email at [hello@philstephens.com](mailto:hello@philstephens.com). You can also use that same address to ping me via Apple Messages if you’re in the Apple ecosystem.

## Elsewhere

I don’t really use social media. You won’t find me on Twitter / X, Instagram, Facebook or Threads. I don’t currently do Mastodon or Bluesky either.

I will occasionally take my **LinkedIn** profile out of hibernation to maintain professional connections that would otherwise be lost - feel free to see if my account is active right now: [https://linkedin.com/in/phil-stephens](https://linkedin.com/in/phil-stephens) (if it isn’t and you want to connect, contact me via [email](mailto:hello@philstephens.com)).

My work necessitates that I have a **Github** profile - I don’t really do much in public with it anymore though: [https://github.com/theprivateer](https://github.com/theprivateer)

I also have a **Strava** profile, although it is fairly locked-down in terms of public visibility. I’m not too concerned about stroking my ego and receiving kudos (anymore) and only occasionally upload new activities that are somewhat notable. Instead I find that the metrics I get from the [HealthFit](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/healthfit/id1202650514) app gives me more than enough insight and functionality, as well as being private and backed-up to my iCloud Drive. I mainly keep Strava around for historic activity data that pre-dates my Apple Watch ownership - at some point I'll see if there is any way I can bring that into HealthFit and shut down my Strava account. Anyways, you can currently find me at: [https://www.strava.com/athletes/389199](https://www.strava.com/athletes/389199)
