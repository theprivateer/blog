This is a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page.

## Currently

- Working my way up to running 10km, having successfully completed the Couch to 5K training programme and established a regular running habit.
- Pondering my relationship with technology and how to organise and maintain my digital life.
- Tinkering with this blog and attempting to build a writing habit.

## Reading

Trying to break the cycle of mindlessly firing-up Netflix in my downtime by borrowing fiction titles from the library (the non-fiction stuff I have on the go can be a little heavy for some evenings).

- [Wool](https://www.kobo.com/au/en/ebook/wool-4)

...and the non-fiction that makes me _think_:

- [Four Thousand Weeks](https://www.kobo.com/au/en/ebook/four-thousand-weeks) (I originally borrowed this from the library, but ended up purchasing it so that I could absorb it slowly)
- [The Daily Stoic](https://www.kobo.com/au/en/ebook/the-daily-stoic-366-meditations-on-wisdom-perseverance-and-the-art-of-living-featuring-new-translations-of-seneca-epictetus-and-marcus-aurelius) (trying to read a section per day, as the title recommends, but have fallen out of that habit recently)

## Listening

- Mostly ambient music.
- From Zero - Linkin Park
